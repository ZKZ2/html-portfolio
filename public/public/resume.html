                <h3>Coursework</h3>
                During my studies, I concentrated on developing a solid foundation in computer engineering with a <br/>
                strong focus on the software aspects of embedded systems.  Many advanced projects helped me to <br/>
                developed the skills and knowledge necessary to design and implement solutions using embedded <br/>
                systems, enabling seamless interaction between hardware and software components.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p>
            <h4>RSA and DES Encryption Using Altera FPGA <span class="resume-date">Fall 2021</span></h4>
            With current demand for data privacy, we wanted to explore the use of cryptography for data <br/>
            transmission.  We designed a secure messaging platform that utilized a pair of programmable FPGA <br/>
            controllers with custom code to implement industry standard RSA/DES encryption.  
        </p></li>
        
        <li><p>
            <h4>Distance Calculator <span class="resume-date">Spring 2022</span></h4>
            Health authorities mandated that a certain distance must be maintained between people to minimize <br/>
            spread of disease.  We designed a distance measurement device for people in queues to ensure these <br/>
            guidelines were met.  The major design goal was to create an affordable solution that would be widely <br/>
            available and rapidly deployable.  Using off the shelf products and a simple feedback mechanism to alert <br/>
            people when they are approaching the safe distance limit.
        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            <h4>Battleship <span class="resume-date">Fall 2022 - Spring 2023</span></h4>
            Team lead of software development team working to redesign the classic game of battleship. <br/>
            The goal was to develop a prototype that would provide more interactivity for players, such as a <br/>
            hardware touch interface and multi color ship markers.  We had to work closely with the hardware team <br/>
            to ensure proper integration between the software and the hardware components.

        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            <h4>RFID Attendance Tracker using 2FA <span class="resume-date">Spring 2023</span></h4>
            Wide spread use of RFID tags and the availability of tools to clone them is a major issue.  We wanted to <br/>
            design and build a proof-of-concept project to prevent unauthorized usage of RFID tags in the attendance <br/>
            tracker. The system implemented two-factor authentication (a passcode prompt) as added protection against <br/>
            clone tags.
